## Motivation

Various services already engage relatively big number of participants, still in many places people struggle to reach critical mass required for starting local groups. Since most services complement each other, rather than compete, establishing interoperability can create synergy and let everyone thrive!

Connecting further with culture of Open Source, Open Standards and Open Data, can help with creating much more transparent, harmonious, concious and fair fundations to build such heterogenous collaboration.

## Roadmap

Just a rough proposal, TBD after discussing it together!

1. Calendar
  * feature: unified calendar aggregating **events** from all interoperating services
  * schemas: Activities/Events - grow, harvest, process, transport, distribute, eat, drink, cook etc.
2. Map
  * feature: unified map aggregating layers with **points of interest** from all interoperating services
  * schemas: POIs - Farm, Garden, DistributionPlace, Kitchen, DinningPlace etc.
3. Food
  * feature: unified way of describing data about food
  * schemas:
    * Produce - common way of describing shared ingredients for food and tracking its sources
    * Meals - common way of describing meals prepared from ingredients (Produce)
 
See [terminology](TERMINOLOGY.md) for how terms in different projects may be related.
